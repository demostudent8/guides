# Nouns, Verbs, and Grammar

## You already know how to program

Programming is the art of getting a computer to do useful things with information.

If you think about it that way, then you already know how to program this computer:

In the case of a calculator, the "information" is numbers and the "useful things" are adding, subtracting, multiplying, etc. Like any computer (or person), we get the calculator to do useful work by writing instructions that it can understand.

For example, if we press the keys <kbd>7</kbd> <kbd>√ó</kbd> <kbd>6</kbd> <kbd>=</kbd> (in that sequence), then the calculator will return `42` on the screen; but if we press the keys <kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>7</kbd> <kbd>=</kbd> <kbd>6</kbd>, then it won't.

- In the above example, `7` and `6` are known as **data**, or as I think of it, _nouns_.
- `x` and `=` are known as **methods**, or as I think of it, _verbs_.
- The order in which we press the keys is known as **syntax**, or as I think of it, _grammar_.
- Altogether, some data and some methods put together using correct syntax form an **expression**, or as I think of it, a _sentence_.
- Given a valid expression, the computer will process it and **return** a piece of useful data back to us.

Got it? Good, because that's basically all that there is to Ruby, too! It's just that Ruby's vocabulary is bigger, and it has a few more grammar rules.

A basic calculator's entire vocabulary consists of the following:

**Data**

<kbd>1</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd> <kbd>3</kbd> <kbd>4</kbd> <kbd>5</kbd> <kbd>6</kbd> <kbd>7</kbd> <kbd>8</kbd> <kbd>9</kbd> <kbd>0</kbd> <kbd>.</kbd>

**Methods**

<kbd>=</kbd> <kbd>+</kbd> <kbd>-</kbd> <kbd>√ó</kbd> <kbd>√∑</kbd> <kbd>%</kbd> <kbd>¬±</kbd> <kbd>AC</kbd>

And there are only a few syntax rules:

- **Primary syntax**: two numbers separated by operator followed by <kbd>=</kbd>
- numbers can contain a single decimal point
- numbers can be modified by the plus/minus sign
- numbers can be modified by the percentage sign
- can press <kbd>AC</kbd> to reset

It's a very small language, but it demonstrates the same parts as any other programming language: **data**, **methods**, and **syntax**.

## Ruby's vocabulary

Okay! Let's get started learning your second programming language ‚Äî Ruby!

First of all, Ruby can work with many more kinds of data than just numbers. That's what makes it much more powerful than the calculator language. Ruby has:

- numbers (and distinguishes between integers and decimals)
- text
- dates
- times
- true/false
- lists containing multiple pieces of data

Each kind, or **class**, of data has its own set of **methods** that it can perform:

- numbers can do the usual computations
- two dates can tell you how far apart they are from one another
- lists can tell how you long they are, or sort themselves

Ruby is known as a "batteries included" language because it includes _so many_ methods out-of-the-box, saving the programmer the trouble of having to re-invent the wheel.

Finally, *we can even make up our own nouns and verbs* and add them to the language. For example, we can (and soon will) create a data type `Venue`, teach it how to transform street addresses into latitude and longitudes, and add that method to its instruction set. Ruby programmers very often share these new classes with one another, making the language ever more powerful and fun to use!

#### Ruby's primary syntax

So, in terms of **data** and **methods**, Ruby comes with a powerful set out-of-the-box *and* is infinitely extensible! That's good news. Here's even more good news: to access all of this power, the **primary syntax** is simple:

```ruby
"hello world!".upcase
```

Here, you[^tradition] try it in this interactive Ruby sandbox:

<iframe frameborder="0" width="100%" height="600px" src="https://repl.it/student_embed/assignment/3043043/c68c4738e364e9b4dbb0b7cf4c224003"></iframe>

[^tradition]: It is a long and time-honored tradition that the very first thing a programmer does in a new language is print out "Hello world!" Congratulations ‚Äî you're now one of us üôåüèæ

On the left side of the dot we have our noun, or, formally, an **object**. On the right side of the dot we have our verb, or, formally, a **method**.

In this case, we asked `"hello world!"`, which is a `String` (Ruby's name for a piece of text[^string_name]), to `upcase` itself, which it (very) happily does.

[^string_name]: The name "string" is used in pretty much every programming language for a piece of text, and refers to a "string of characters", from back when we used to have to worry about dealing with individual characters (for memory reasons). Now we never really think about individual characters anymore, but the name "string" stuck with us.



What if we try asking the number `9` to downcase itself? Try it right now in `rails console`.

```ruby
9.downcase
```

Aha! `NoMethodError: undefined method 'downcase' for 9:Fixnum`. It looks scary, but one of your main objectives during this course is to **not panic** when you see an error message. Slow down, read it carefully, and see if you can make any sense of it at all. Over time, you will find that they are very helpful ‚Äî and you will miss them when something is going wrong *silently*.

In this case, it is saying: "Hey, dummy ‚Äî you can't downcase 9, which is a number." Fair enough. (`Fixnum` means "integer", as opposed to `Float` which means "decimal number". Almost all programming languages use two distinct data types for those two things.)

At all times as you are writing Ruby, you should be thinking: **What class of object do I have?** **What methods can I call on this kind of object?**

Alright, so the **primary syntax** in Ruby is very simple ‚Äî `object.method`. However, here's one small wrinkle: some methods require additional inputs. For example, there is a method called `gsub` which we can call on `String`s, which will substitute characters with other characters. Try it:

```ruby
"Hello".gsub("l", "z")
```

In order to do its job, the `gsub` method needs to know what character to substitute and what to replace it with. So we give it inputs, or **arguments**, which must come in parentheses immediately following the method (**no space after the method name**). If the method takes multiple arguments, as `gsub` does, then they are separated by commas.

In reality, `gsub` is more often used to do things like removing illegal characters from usernames before saving:

```ruby
"D+h+H".gsub("+", "")
```

(`""` is an empty string, so all `+`s get replaced with nothing.)

Now that you've seen arguments, you know the full **primary syntax** of Ruby. No kidding: `object.method(argument1, argument2, ...)` is the *vast* majority of what we'll be writing. That's it.

"But wait!," you say, "what about when I do math like `7 * 6`? That is clearly not `object.method`." A very good question. Try this instead: `7.*(6)` What?!

Why does this work? `*` is the name of a method on the `Fixnum` class, which takes an argument of another `Fixnum`, and returns the product of the two. üò≥üí•üò≤

When [Yukihiro Matsumoto](https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz) designed the Ruby language, his goal was "developer happiness" (which was radical at that time, 1993, when most languages were geared for computer efficiency).

He knew that if he made developers type `7.*(6)` every time they wanted to multiply two numbers, they would not be happy campers. So he included a few bits of "syntactic sugar", or shortcuts, that boil down to `object.method` under the hood, but allow us to retain our sanity while typing. Phew.

One last thing: you can **chain** methods, like so:

```ruby
"D+h+H".gsub("+", "").downcase
```

Ruby evaluates the expression from left to right, replacing each `object.method` expression with the `object` that it returns and then evaluating the next `object.method`.

So you have to be careful and make sure that the `object` that the first `object.method` returns matches up with the second `method.` **What class of object do I have?** **What methods can I call on this kind of object?**

#### Variables

Remember, you can use your up and down arrows to scroll through your command history. But Ruby has a more important way to save data: we can create a box in memory to hold it and give that box a name, like so:

```ruby
s = "Hello" # Create a box, label it `s`, and store "Hello" in it
s # Retrieve the value in `s`
s.capitalize
s.reverse
s.upcase
```

You could also throw away what you have in the box labeled `s` and put in something new:

```ruby
s = "hi"
s
s = 60 * 60
s
```

You could even replace the value in the box with an updated version of the old value, because the instructions on the right side of the equals sign are executed before the throwing away happens:

```ruby
s = "hi"
s
s = s.capitalize
s
```

And you can create as many of these boxes as you want:

```ruby
a = "hi"
b = "there"
c = "world"
a
b
c
```
So, in addition to `object.method`, **the syntax you need to know like the back of your hand is**

```ruby
storage_box = the_final_value.resulting_from_this(expression).will_be_stored
# This code won't actually work
```

*First*, the expression on the right will be evaluated until there are no instructions left and there's just a piece of data remaining.

*Then*, the value will be placed in a variable called `storage_box`, which will be created if it doesn't exist, or will have its value replaced if it does.

Most programs are just a long succession of statements where we do some work with `object.method` and store the result in some variable, then we do some more work on that variable and store the result in yet another variable, and a hundred steps later we've produced our final result and we display that to our user:

```ruby
user_input = "D+h+H"
input_without_pluses = user_input.gsub("+", "")
downcased_input = input_without_pluses.downcase
"dhh" == downcased_input
# if true, choose another username!
```

When you are choosing your variable names, there are some rules:

- names can only contain **lowercase** letters, numbers, and underscores
- names cannot begin with a number

Rubyists strive to choose descriptive variable names, no matter how long they are, so that the code reads almost like English ‚Äî avoid naming your variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. Use underscores to separate words in multiple word variable names.

## Conclusion

That's it for the primary syntax of Ruby!

```
storage_box = object.method(argument1, argument2, ...)
```

Now, we need to spend some time *expanding our vocabulary*. Let's start with [the most fundamental built-in classes that Ruby gives us](fundamental-classes.md).
