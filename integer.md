# Integer
`Integer` is Ruby's name for integers. You can prove it by doing

```ruby
7.class
```

In fact, you can always call `.class` on *any* object, ever, at any time, to ask it what class it is. You can also call `.methods` to find out what all it can do, but the resulting list is pretty hard to look at so I usually use some other resources instead, which I'll direct you to later.

## Methods
Let's experiment with some common methods for `Integer`s
### `odd?`

### `rand`

### `to_s`

### `+` `-` `*` `/` `**`
