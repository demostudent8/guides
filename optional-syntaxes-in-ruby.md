# Optional Syntaxes in Ruby

Ruby, unlike many other languages, often supports multiple syntaxes to achieve the same thing. This is both good and bad. It's good because it lets us choose a style that we are most comfortable with, but it's bad because we need to learn to at least recognize multiple styles so that we can read other people's code.

Here are a few optional syntaxes to become familiar with:

## New Hash Syntax

Consider a `Hash`:

```ruby
{ :fruit => "banana", :sport => "hockey" }
```



## Parentheses around arguments

## Curly brackets around hash arguments

## Single line blocks
